# Movie App

built with React, Apollo, and GraphQL

## Initail install on Jan 08 2021

yarn add styled-components react-router-dom @apollo/client graphql

## deprecated

After Apollo Client updated to v3, 'apollo-boost' and '@apollo/react-hooks' seem to be merged into '@apollo/client'.
So you should import 'ApolloClient' and 'ApolloProvider' from '@apollo/client' if your Apollo Client is v3.

apollo-boost, @apollo/react-hooks => @apollo/client
